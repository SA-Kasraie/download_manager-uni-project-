Only made cause it was recommended to use github

simple donwload manager using requests library in python
got the code from geekforgeek, modified it, added a few features, read it, understood it (i'm a noob(scriptkidde i know that)

It can't download everything as it has problem with tokens cookies and stuff...it's as simple as it is

Installation: there's no need for such thing

usage: python <path>/dl.py <url> <save_directory>
example: python D:/.../dl.py https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.5.3.tar.gz D:/
